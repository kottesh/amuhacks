#### Theme: Finance  
#### Project: Quid - An AI Expense Tracker. 

We know there are number of expense or budgeting apps in the market. But most of the apps require the user to do the manually entry for categorizing each of the transaction that they make in their daily life. But it's a lot of work right. So here, we present **Quid** An AI powered expense tracking app.

In which you just tell what are the expense which you have made. Quid will automatically categorize it and store it for you and provides you with analytics.
